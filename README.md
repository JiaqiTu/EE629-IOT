# EE629 Real-time video streaming based on Flusk

**Description:** In this project, I use a normal Raspberry Pi camera and stream the video to the Web page which implemented by a web server.

**File location:** Flask uses the directory ```app.py``` located as the general directory. By default, static valuable is in the ```static``` directory, and template is in the ```templates``` directory.

 I also bought a DHT11 and want to put temperature and humidity on the same page.
