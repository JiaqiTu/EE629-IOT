I bought a Raspberry Pi camera module and want to set up to take photos or stream video and users can keep an eye on maybe their pets.

* Web temperature monitor

rpi_tempmon.py is a python script to display the CPU & GPU temperature of Raspberry Pi. I want to use rpi_tempmon.py to generate the real time temperatures & graphics and put on to the website.
